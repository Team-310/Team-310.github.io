#Lessons Learned#

1. We learned how to use MPLAB to program PIC Microcontrollers.
2. We learned how to use a reflow oven to solder surface mount components.
3. We learned how to make components communicate with a microcontroller using SPI or I2C.
4. We learned how to carefully select components for our project's needs.
5. We learned how to use Cadence to create electrical schematics.
6. We learned how to use schematics from Cadence to make PCBs.
7. We learned how to use in circuit programming to program PIC Microcontrollers.
8. We learned how to use an ESP32 to host a webserver to display data.
9. We learned how to use EUSART to print data to a port.
10. We learned how to use interrupts to allow multiple parts of a program to work simultaneously.

#Recommendations#

1. Research your components and how they work before you buy them.
2. Use Ultra Library when designing your Cadence schematic to save time.
3. Know what ports your microcontroller will need to use before you make your schematic.
4. Finish your PCB designs with plenty of time to fix them before they are due.
5. Add extra headers wherever you have a pin connection.
