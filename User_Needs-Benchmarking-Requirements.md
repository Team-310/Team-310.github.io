# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements  
## Summary  
paste  
Team 310 initiated the user needs identification phase by conducting a comprehensive review of numerous existing products. From this pool, the team selected five distinctive weather station-related products for research purposes. thoroughly read reviews from their selected product, ensuring a thorough examination of both positive and negative feedback. Through this review process, recurring user needs were identified and categorized as either latent or explicit.
With the identified user needs as a foundation, the team conducted a brainstorming session using Google Jamboard, generating an additional 100 potential needs. A detailed analysis of these needs revealed five distinct categories: Appearance, Safety, Functionality, Features, and Usability. Utilizing these categories, each “sticky note” need was organized and rated on a scale from one to three stars.
To progress in the design process, the team studied three distinct user stories focusing on Interaction Examples, Venues, and Stakeholder Interactions. This exploration provided invaluable insights into user needs and informed decisions regarding Hardware, Software, Interactivity & User Experience, Customization, Manufacturing, and Safety aspects of the product. This information gave our team a deeper understanding of user needs and the aspects we needed to implement into our final design
After a thorough assessment of the project requirements, the team decided upon the sensors that would be used in the final design. Furthermore, considerations of user needs and personal preferences decided upon the implementation of sensors in an aesthetically pleasing way to ensure it meets the needs of our intended audience.
A comprehensive overview of the Jamboard process, including both unorganized and organized user needs, is provided in the Appendix.
