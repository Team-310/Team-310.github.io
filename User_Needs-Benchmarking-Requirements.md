# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements  
## Summary  
paste  
Team 310 began the user needs identification process by reviewing multiple existing products avaiable to the public. The team chose 5 unqiue weather station related products to benchmark. Each member thouroghly read reviews from their selected product, making sure to read the poorly starred reviews as well as the 5 star reviews. From these reviews, we identified reoccuring user needs and classified them as either latent or explicit. With the ideantified user needs in mind, we brainstormed 100 additional needs using Google Jamboard. We found 5 different categories after analyzing our written needs; Appearance, Safety, Functionality, Features, Usability. Using these categories, we sorted each "sticky note" into its coresponding category then rated them from 3 to 1 stars. To decide upon the Hardware, Software, Interactivity & User Experience, Customization, Manufacturing, and Safety aspects of our product, we studied three different user stories. These cases included Interaction Examples, Venues, and Stakeholder Interactions to give our team a deeper understanding of user needs and the aspects we needed to implement into our final design. The team assessed the requirements for the project and decided upon each sensor we would implement into our design. We also took the user needs and our personal prefernces to impliment the sensors in an aesthetically pleasing way to ensure it meets the needs of our intended audience. A detailed view of the Jamboard process, including the unorganized and organized user needs, can be found in the Appendex.
