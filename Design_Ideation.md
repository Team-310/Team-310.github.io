# Design Ideation

## Roles
Everyone worked on generating ideas together. We wrote ideas on sticky notes, and if we noticed duplicates, we would create new ideas. No idea was a bad idea. The objective of this portion of the Design Ideation was to come up with as many ideas as possible to then pick the idea that contained all of our requirements. We then organized all of the ideas into 5 categories. Those categories were appearance, safety, functionality, features, and usability.

## Idea Generation
The brainstorming that worked the best was spitballing ideas and seeing what the general consensus from the group was. If there was a positive reception, we would write the idea down. Initially, no idea was a bad idea. We began with more than 80 ideas. Then we went through the list and categorized all of the ideas into the categories stated above. While going through this process we started to cut some ideas.

[Refer to Figure 6 in Appendix](Appendix.md)

Then we went through each idea and decided how important they were. Once we established how important ideas were, we ranked them from 1 to 3 stars within their respective categories. This allowed us to see exactly where our priorities were. We then began to brainstorm products as a whole. We use most of our 3-star ideas and combined them into rough drafts of products. We were able to create 3 mock products with different features.
