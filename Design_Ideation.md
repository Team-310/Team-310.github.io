# Design Ideation

## Roles
Everyone worked on generating ideas together. We wrote ideas on sticky notes, and if we noticed duplicates, we would create new ideas. Angie was in charge of organizing the ideas once they were finished.

## Idea Generation
The brainstorming that worked the best was spitballing ideas and seeing what the general consensus from the group was. If there was positive reception, we would write the idea down.

[Refer to Figure 6 in Appendix](Appendix.md)

The process for ranking ideas was primarily by gut feeling. We went through each idea and decided how important they were. Once we established how important ideas were, we ranked them from 1 to 3 stars.
