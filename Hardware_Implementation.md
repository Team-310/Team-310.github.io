Team 310 chose this circuit design because it was the cleanest version that could meet all our user needs as well as the project requirements. The temperature and pressure sensor satisfy the product requirements while also giving the user crucial weather information. The motor subsystem provides a visual indication that the device is active and gathering data. By spinning the flower, it adds an aesthetically pleasing aspect to our product to fulfill user needs. The ESP32 allows the user to receive the temperature and pressure data via WIFI, meeting the project requirements and adding an extra feature well liked by the user. The microcontroller controls all the subsystems for smooth operation and WIFI control that anyone can use. Overall, the product is designed to exceed user expectations by providing data about the weather and acting as aesthetically pleasing home decor.
