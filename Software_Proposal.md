## Summary ##
Our Software Block diagram contains all the necessary functions that are required for this design to work properly. It laos contains all requirements from the assignment. The software is able to enable interupts. It also will be able to control the sensors and gather data from. It will activate the motor while the sensors are gathering data. This will allow the user to have a visual and audial stimulus that will let them know the weather station is working. When the sensors are finished gathering data, the controller will interpret it and send it to the ESP32. Finally, the ESP32 will be able to interface with the internet where the user will be able to view the data on their phone.
