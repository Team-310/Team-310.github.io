# Team Organization  
## Summary  
In the spirit of collaborative innovation, our team convened multiple brainstorming sessions to establish a charter that reflects our collective vision and individual strengths. Through these discussions, we identified key values and objectives, ensuring each voice was heard and integrated into our final consensus. This report encapsulates the synergy of our ideas and the strategic framework we've adopted.

Central to our operational framework is the emphasis on effective communication, primarily through text and Discord, supplemented by structured meetings every Friday. We've also instituted a system where key team roles, such as Meeting Leader and Assignment Leader, are rotated to ensure equitable responsibility distribution and to foster a sense of shared ownership. This approach not only emphasizes teamwork and accountability but also underpins our commitment to a collaborative approach and constructive conflict resolution. For a more detailed insight into our team roles and communication preferences, [See Appendix: Team Organization for tables](Appendix.md). 

## Charter  
The process of developing our team goals was an iterative one that took a fair amount of thought and consideration. We valued open dialogue and constructive feedback that refined our objectives in line with the project needs, pooling in a lot of diverse skills.

Our charter crystallizes this dynamic exchange; it sets the stage that the product must be, yes, functional and durable, but also that it engages the homeowner on an aesthetic level. In line with this commitment, we shall be committed to a trajectory of continuous learning and technological exploration, viewing the project as a stepping stone for professional development and networking. 

## Misson Statement  
Crafting our mission statement was an exercise in distilling our project's essence into a clear and compelling narrative. 

**We unite innovation with aesthetics to create durable, functional products that resonate with homeowners. Embracing open dialogue and continuous learning, our team leverages diverse skills for professional growth and networking, committed to transforming challenges into stepping stones for success.**
