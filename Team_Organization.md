# Team Organization  
## Summary  
In the spirit of collaborative innovation, our team convened multiple brainstorming sessions to establish a charter that reflects our collective vision and individual strengths. Through these discussions, we identified key values and objectives, ensuring each voice was heard and integrated into our final consensus. This report encapsulates the synergy of our ideas and the strategic framework we've adopted.

Central to our operational framework is the emphasis on effective communication, primarily through text and Discord, supplemented by structured meetings every Friday. We've also instituted a system where key team roles, such as Meeting Leader and Assignment Leader, are rotated to ensure equitable responsibility distribution and to foster a sense of shared ownership. This approach not only emphasizes teamwork and accountability but also underpins our commitment to a collaborative approach and constructive conflict resolution. For a more detailed insight into our team roles and communication preferences, [See Appendix: Team Organization for tables](Appendix.md). 

## Charter  
Our team's goals were created through a lengthy procedure that involved extensive research and discussion. We valued open communication and helpful criticism which enabled us fine-tune our goals to better meet the demands of the project while combining a wide range of expertise.

This constant interchange is captured in our charter, which establishes the need for the product to be both aesthetically pleasing and durable. In keeping with this pledge, we will be dedicated to an ongoing path of technological research and learning, seeing the project as a platform for networking and professional growth.


## Misson Statement  
Crafting our mission statement was an exercise in distilling our project's essence into a clear and compelling narrative.
