# Team Organization  
## Summary  
In the spirit of collaborative innovation, our team convened multiple brainstorming sessions to establish a charter that reflects our collective vision and individual strengths. Through these discussions, we identified key values and objectives, ensuring each voice was heard and integrated into our final consensus. This report encapsulates the synergy of our ideas and the strategic framework we've adopted.

Central to our operational framework is the emphasis on effective communication, primarily through text and Discord, supplemented by structured meetings every Friday. We've also instituted a system where key team roles, such as Meeting Leader and Assignment Leader, are rotated to ensure equitable responsibility distribution and to foster a sense of shared ownership. This approach not only emphasizes teamwork and accountability but also underpins our commitment to a collaborative approach and constructive conflict resolution. For a more detailed insight into our team roles and communication preferences, [See Appendix: Team Organization for tables](Appendix.md).
