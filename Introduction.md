## Introduction
Greetings! We are Team 310, a group united by our passion for seamlessly blending technology with aesthetics. Our latest project the Flora Forecast is the perfect fusion of functionality and design, introducing a smart device that not only serves a technical purpose but also adds an interactive and aesthetic touch to your living space.  

Inspired by a potted plant, our device seamlessly integrates into any home or environment. The spinning flower head, a unique and captivating feature, adds an engaging touch without being intrusive. Our design prioritizes both aesthetics and functionality, meeting the highest user needs and offering a harmonious blend of technology and nature.  

Nestled within the flower head is our carefully designed motor, spinning elegantly when a user requests data from the ESP-32. This captivating motion not only indicates active data processing but also introduces an engaging element to our product. Hidden in the leaves, pressure, and temperature sensors gather essential environmental data while maintaining the product's visual appeal. Our battery and PCB are discreetly concealed within the pot, enhancing waterproofing and keeping main components easily accessible. Wires connecting the ESP-32 and Microcontrollers are neatly hidden within the stems, ensuring a sleek appearance.  

In essence, Team 310 introduces not just a product, but an experience â€“ a perfect union of innovation, user-centric design, and the seamless integration of technology and aesthetics. Explore the beauty and functionality of the Flora Forecast, where form meets function in perfect harmony.
