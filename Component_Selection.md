## Power Supply - 9V Battery  
![Battery](https://github.com/Team-310/Team-310.github.io/assets/157059404/c82bdb55-c936-455e-97de-ff75d56ad892)  
Our team chose this 9V battery to power the Flora Forecast because they are readily available. The user can easily replace the battery too. The 9V battery supplies enough power for up to 2 hours of constant use of our device.  

## Voltage Regulator - [LM2575D2T-3.3R4G](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/LM2575D2T-3.3R4G/5801702?utm_adgroup=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PMax%20Shopping_Product_Medium%20ROAS%20Categories&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_id=go_cmp-20223376311_adg-_ad-__dev-c_ext-_prd-5801702_sig-CjwKCAiAibeuBhAAEiwAiXBoJHnZP0vQYhg2BseQ3jPSFarn2P5zuhtLkV188zWd8XpeyW5NurhlyRoC53MQAvD_BwE&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAibeuBhAAEiwAiXBoJHnZP0vQYhg2BseQ3jPSFarn2P5zuhtLkV188zWd8XpeyW5NurhlyRoC53MQAvD_BwE)

Our team ultimately chose the LM2575D2T-3 as our 3.3V switching voltage regulator for the weather station project, prioritizing its perfect alignment with our voltage requirements and its high efficiency for power conservation. Despite being slightly pricier at 10/$1.49, the regulator's low dropout and compact design justified the extra cost by ensuring reliable performance and fitting within our design constraints. The LM2575D2T-3 direct 3.3V output simplifies our system, avoiding the need for additional regulation and making it an ideal choice for our battery-powered, outdoor application.

## Motor - [LS-00028](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osepp-electronics-ltd/LS-00028/11198652)  
![Motor](https://github.com/Team-310/Team-310.github.io/assets/157059404/938f106a-640f-4d7f-b0f9-9414d8ad850c)  
Our team chose this motor because of its small size and voltage requirement. Since the motor will not need to move heavy parts, only light plastic pieces, it is ideal for our project. It also has a simple design, so it will be easy to implement it.

## Temperature Sensor - [TC74A4](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/TC74A4-3-3VCTTR/443268)

## Barometric Pressure Sensor - [BME280](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bosch-sensortec/BME280/6136306)  
![Pressure](https://github.com/Team-310/Team-310.github.io/assets/157059404/97e0b5b0-e32a-4cbd-b10e-c8bf5a444dda)  
Our team chose the BME 280 Combined humidity and pressure sensor because it acts as a humidity and pressure sensor in one. Despite being the most expensive one, it comes with a very detailed datasheet that makes it easy to set up. While it may be more difficult to solder, the team has come up with a plan to successfully solder this part onto a PCB. The main supply voltage ranges from 1.71 V to 3.6 V, which is perfect for this project's power  requirements. It is also the most accurate from 32 degrees to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, making it ideal for the Arizona weather that can reach up to 121 degrees.

- Our power budget analysis indicates that, when operating at full capacity continuously, the product provides approximately 2 hours of runtime. However, we expect users to enjoy longer periods of use, as it's unlikely the device will be consistently running at maximum. We've also made battery replacement straightforward, and for those interested in sustainability, the product is compatible with rechargeable batteries, enhancing its eco-friendly appeal.
