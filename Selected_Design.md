## **Motor**
* Located in the flower head, the motor is designed to spin the flower when the user sends a request to the ESP-32 for data. The spinning flower shows the user that the system is actively reading data. For user needs it provides a visual indicator of operation and adds an interactive element to our product.

## **Sensors**
* Both the pressure and temperature sensors are hidden in the leaves which provides the aesthetic of the product while creating a functioning product to gather environmental data which were both expressed as user needs.

## **Battery and PCB**
* The essential components are all concealed within the pot which provides waterproofing and keeps the main components accessible while maintaining being hidden. Both the ESP-32 and Microcontrollers will be attached to the PCB with the wires being hidden in the stems connecting to the other components' PCB.

## **Design Aesthetic**
* The overall design mimics a potted plant, this can blend into any home or environment while serving a technical purpose. The spinning flower head is a unique feature that engages users and provides a non intrusive way to indicate our product is working correctly. All of these aspects were ranked the highest in our user needs.
